Reference
==========

Defines a field type to let entities reference other entities in Backdrop.

This module is the sucessor to both references and entity_reference in Drupal 7,
and will one day include all the features from both, along with an upgrade path.
When that has been accomplished, this module will be moved into Backdrop core.

This module is still under development, and should only be used with the
understanding that it will likely need to have patches applied.

That being said, most of the core functionality is ready, so please help us test
